## P2P/NodeIDs
Randomly generated UUID
Should we add enode ids?
How do NodeIDs work?
New Each time Node Starts
Old NodeIDs expire after ... 1 hr?
3 bad pings // removed from active
set "my ip" and avoid it for connections and pings
-OR-
compare node_uuids with connection return since "my_ip" will not be avail on the local iface

NEXT
send HELLO and compare versions.. if OK then add to PeerManager.authorized_peers
authorized_peers should be checked before each actions besides CONNECT and HELLO

Get timestamps right so connected_peers that are not authorized_peers after 1 minute are disconnected

make sure hanging conditions are safe

DIG up Credo

get elixir 1.6 with code formatting... ugh

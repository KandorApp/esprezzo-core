## P2P/NodeIDs
Randomly generated UUID
Should we add enode ids?
How do NodeIDs work?
New Each time Node Starts
Old NodeIDs expire after ... 1 hr?
3 bad pings // removed from active
set "my ip" and avoid it for connections and pings
-OR-
compare node_uuids with connection return since "my_ip" will not be avail on the local iface

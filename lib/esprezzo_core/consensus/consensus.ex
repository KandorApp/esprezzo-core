defmodule EsprezzoCore.Consensus do
  @moduledoc"""
    This is where all the blockchain level 
    consensus should happen.

    Questions answered should be

    - Who has the longest chain?
    - Am I on the right chain?

    - The networking will still happen via PeerNet
    - Some of the chatter not related to P2P connections should be moved here
